# server

The placement server. It takes a scan of the wall around the electric meter and answers whether a Base Power battery fits, where, and why. The decision is plain code; every threshold lives in `rules.yaml` with its citation.

## Run

Needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) 0.11. From `server/`:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `uv sync --locked` | Install |
| `uv run uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` | Serve the API |
| `uv run python siteplan.py scene.json plan.svg` | Solve one scene and write its site plan |
| `uv run pytest -q`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format .` | Test and lint (`make server` runs what CI runs) |

Without the web layer: `loaded = load_rules()`, then `solve(parse_scene(raw, loaded.rules), loaded)` (from `rules`, `scene` and `solver`).

## Deploy

The public demo runs at **https://house-scanning-server.vercel.app** (Vercel project `house-scanning-server`, public rules only). Redeploy from this directory:

```sh
npx vercel@latest deploy --prod --scope sam-gus-projects-7a4b6082
```

Only `server/` uploads (`.vercelignore`), so the repository's `private/` rules can't reach a deployment; `/health` shows `sources: ["public"]`. Vercel caps a request body at 4.5 MB, so send bare `scene.json`: the solver doesn't read the images, and a zip must hold every JPEG its `scene.json` names or it is refused with 422 `missing_bundle_file`. The project isn't connected to Git: a deploy is always this command.

## API

| Endpoint | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | | Which rules are loaded, and their hash |
| `POST /v1/placements` | a scene | The result, `schemas/result.schema.json` |
| `POST /v1/placements/site-plan.svg` | a scene | The site plan, `image/svg+xml` |
| `GET /v1/schemas/scene.json`, `GET /v1/schemas/result.json` | | The contract this server honours |

A scene is bare `scene.json` (`application/json`), a zip holding `scene.json` and the JPEGs it names (`application/zip`), or either one as the multipart field `bundle`. `/openapi.json` declares all three.

```sh
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/placements -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @tests/fixtures/example-scene.json | jq .decision
```

A refusal is `{"error": {"code", "message", "path"}}`, where `path` is the JSON pointer of the field at fault:

| Status | When |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | The body or zip can't be read, or a zip entry has an absolute or `..` path |
| 413 | Over `HOUSESCAN_MAX_UPLOAD_MB` (default 256), unzipped over `HOUSESCAN_MAX_UNZIPPED_MB` (default 512), or `scene.json` itself over `HOUSESCAN_MAX_SCENE_MB` (default 10) |
| 415 | Not JSON, zip or multipart |
| 422 | The scene breaks `schemas/scene.schema.json`, names an image the zip lacks, can't be placed (for example the meter is far from its wall), or needs more than 50,000 positions or 8 s to check (`scene_too_complex`; refused as soon as the pace of the first positions shows it) |

## Writing a scene

`schemas/scene.schema.json` is the contract; it only gains optional fields. Lengths are feet.

- Wall `baseline` points run **left to right as seen from outside**, and walls are listed in that order. That fixes each wall's outward side.
- `s` is feet along the walls from the meter, negative to the left. `span_ft` and coverage use it.
- `coverage` lists what the capture actually saw, and whether each end of the walk is a real `limit` or `unexplored`. Anything unseen makes the checks that depend on it UNSURE, so a scene without `coverage` can't pass.
- A limit end (a fence, a corner) doesn't clear the ground beyond it: a pool there still counts. Ground seen past a limit end, a `span_ft` beyond the chain's end, covers both sides of the wall's continued line, so pointing the camera past the end settles it. Past an unexplored end only walking on does.
- Give an object a plan `footprint` when it stands off the wall (a regulator, an AC unit), or clearances are measured to its stretch of wall line.
- Omit `plus_minus_ft` and AR-placed positions get `rules.yaml`'s default error for their source plus 0.16 ft per foot along the walls from the meter, from measured ARKit drift. Send your own when you know better.

## What settles each check

A check is settled when everything it depends on is observed and measured; then it passes or fails on the numbers. What follows is the coverage (`coverage.observed`) and the measurements each check needs, so a capture that supplies exactly this gets a decision on the first upload. Values in brackets are the public rules (`rules.yaml`); private rules may differ, and a request always names the exact span and depth.

Notation, all in feet: the battery stands at s from `s0` to `s1` (width W = 2.58, depth D = 1.83). `e` is the wall's position error at the battery's far edge from the meter: the wall's `plus_minus_ft`, or the default 0.3 plus 0.16 per foot along the walls from the meter. `r` is a check's rule value. A ground band "over [a, b] out to d" means an observed `{"band": "ground", "span_ft": [a, b], "out_ft": d}` (or several that together cover it).

| Check | Reads | Coverage that settles it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wall_backing` | `walls` | wall band over [s0, s1] |
| `ground_surface` | `ground` patches | ground over [s0 − e, s1 + e] out to D + e, and a patch of an allowed type under the whole footprint |
| `meter_working_space` | `meter` | nothing to observe |
| `gas_clearance` (r = 3) | `objects` of type `gas_meter`, with `footprint` when it stands off the wall | ground over [s0 − r − e, s1 + r + e] out to D + r + e, and wall band over the same span |
| `ac_clearance` (r = 3), `pool_clearance` (r = 10) | `objects` of type `ac`, `pool` | ground over [s0 − r − e, s1 + r + e] out to D + r + e |
| `drive_clearance` (r = 5) | `ground` patches of type `drive` | as above |
| `opening_clearance` (r = 3) | `objects` of type `door`, `window`, `garage_door`; `attrs.operable` and `attrs.well` for windows | wall band over [s0 − r − e, s1 + r + e] |
| `wall_equipment_above` (r = 0) | `objects` of type `elec_box`, `vent` | wall band over [s0 − r, s1 + r] |
| `facing_gap` (r = 3, from the battery's front) | `facing` measurements | facing band over [s0, s1]. Where no `facing` entry covers it, the band's `out_ft` must exceed D + r (4.83): a walked path proves the space clear out to where the homeowner walked. No `out_ft` means the view reached whatever faces the wall, and it is in `facing` |
| `headroom` (r = 6.5) | `overheads` measurements | overhead band over [s0, s1]. Where no `overheads` entry covers it, the band's `out_ft` (height seen clear) must exceed r. No `out_ft` means seen clear all the way up, as from a tilt-up view of open sky |
| `route_path` | `walls`, openings on the route | wall band from the meter to the battery's near edge |
| `route_length` | `walls`, `meter` | nothing to observe |

Errors: a measured value passes only when it clears the rule by more than its error. Objects take the default error for their `source` (tape 0.05, tap 0.3, vlm 1.5, plus 0.16 per foot along the walls for tap and vlm) unless they carry `plus_minus_ft`; `facing` and `overheads` entries default to the mesh error, 0.5. Every `out_ft` is taken as exact, so report the distance you are sure of (for a walked path, the distance from the wall less your position error).

Ends and corners:

- A corner the walk follows is the next wall in `walls`, starting at the corner point; the chain is then continuous and the corner raises nothing. Keep walking until the answer's `ends.<side>.beyond_reach` is true or the wall really ends.
- `unexplored` means the wall continues. Within cable reach it raises a `past_end` request when no spot passes, because a spot may be round it; nothing else settles it.
- `limit` means no usable wall past it. Ground past a limit end still counts for clearances (a pool behind a fence is still a pool): show it by pointing the camera past the end, reported as a ground span beyond the chain's end, which covers both sides of the wall's continued line.

Supplying exactly what a request in `missing_evidence` names settles it: a `coverage.observed` entry with its `band` and `span_ft`, and an `out_ft` at least the request's `out_ft` (ground, facing and overhead requests carry one).

## Reading a result

`decision` is `pass`, `manual_review` or `reject`. `spot` gives the battery's plan footprint and `meter_offset_ft`, its offset from the meter for AR; `route` is the cable run. Each entry in `checks` has an outcome, a reason, the measurement, its error and the rule it was held to:

| Check | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `wall_backing` | Flush on one straight, observed stretch of wall |
| `ground_surface` | Standing on an allowed surface |
| `meter_working_space` | Clear of the NEC 110.26 space in front of the meter |
| `gas_clearance`, `ac_clearance`, `pool_clearance`, `drive_clearance`, `opening_clearance` | Far enough from every part of each object, and the area in between was seen |
| `wall_equipment_above` | No box or vent on the wall above |
| `facing_gap`, `headroom` | Enough room in front and above |
| `route_path`, `route_length` | The cable runs along continuous wall, and isn't too long |

A check passes only when its margin exceeds its error and fails only when it misses by more than its error; anything else is UNSURE with an `unsure_cause`. `missing_evidence` lists the views that would settle an unseen area; showing exactly what a `band` request names settles it, and a `past_end` request asks to walk on. When a measurement only might lie in front of or over the battery (its end is within the wall's position error of the battery's edge), `measured_ft ± plus_minus_ft` spans the values the check could have, so the numbers give the same UNSURE. A reject needs every spot within cable reach to fail and both ends of the walk known.

## Rules

`rules.yaml` holds the public values. `placeholder: true` marks a value with no public source; because it has some, it sets `auto_approve: false`, which turns every pass or reject into manual review. At startup the server merges a git-ignored `private/rules.yaml` over it when one exists (path: `HOUSESCAN_PRIVATE_RULES`, else `<repo root>/private/rules.yaml`). Every value the private file sets must carry its own `source`, or the server refuses to start; answers show those citations only as "Private rules". Never commit Base's values. Base-derived tests live beside them in `private/tests/`: `uv run pytest ../private/tests -q`.
