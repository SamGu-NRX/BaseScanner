"""The app's 3D map (Map3D, t3/ios-map3d) against the same truth as CoverageMap (METHODS.md section 7c).

The app's code runs unmodified through `map3d_driver/`, built against a read-only checkout of
HouseScanKit at `KIT_COMMIT`. Its LiDAR path is fed one depth frame per ETH3D photo, 256 x 192,

with section 7's truth; its facing and overhead claims with a seen-empty test on the same laser
