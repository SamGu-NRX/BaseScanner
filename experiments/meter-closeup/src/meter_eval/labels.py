"""Merge the two readers' labels into the committed manifest.csv.

Both readers are AI models that read each photo by eye (reader 1 is the experiment author,
reader 2 an independent pass that never saw reader 1's labels). The label is always reader
1's number, so reader 1 chose which printed identifier counts as the meter number. Two
agreement rules are recorded:

- number_agreed (the loose rule the headline results use): reader 1's number, normalized,
  equals any number reader 2 listed (its main number or one of its other numbers), or one
  contains the other and the shorter has at least 6 characters (a barcode line such as
  ACG012345678 printing the plate number 12 345 678). Neither reader may have doubted a
  character.
- number_agreed_strict: both readers' main numbers are identical after normalization and
  both readers were sure.

A person's answers from the review page (`review.py`), when present: "keep" makes a number
agreed under both rules; "fix" replaces the number with the person's reading but does not
by itself make it agreed.

Plaintext labels stay in the data directory. The manifest keeps keyed digests (match.py),
and identifier_digests.txt keeps the digest of every identifier either reader transcribed,
so `leakcheck` can find one in the repository without the plaintext.
