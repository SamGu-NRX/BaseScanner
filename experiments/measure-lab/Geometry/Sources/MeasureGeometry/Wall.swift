/// - `direction` u is the horizontal part of contact2 − contact1, normalized. The sign follows tap
///   order, so along-wall coordinates grow from the first contact toward the second.
/// - `normal` n = u × g with g = (0, 1, 0), flipped if needed so it points to the side of the wall
///   the camera was on. Positive offsets are in front of the wall, where the user stands.
/// - The ground line is the straight 3D line through both contacts. Heights are measured above it,
///   which follows a ground that slopes along the wall.
