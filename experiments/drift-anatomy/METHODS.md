# Drift anatomy: methods and full results

The README is the front door. This file keeps the method as it was pre-registered in 397507f, and the full result as the run reported it.

## Question

The server allows 0.16 ft of error per foot along the wall. That allowance dominates a check's error bar beyond a few feet, so which part of ARKit's error is worth attacking? The data is MARViN (iPhone 14 Pro Max, bar and church, walks within 10% of the reference's scale) and ADVIO 20–22 (iPhone 6s), using the evals' windows.

- **A1, return to the meter.** When a walk comes back within 0.3 m of an earlier point more than 30 s later, ARKit's closure residual r is the error in the displacement between the two visits. Does r bound the largest error between the visits?
- **A2, scale.** Is ARKit's scale one number per walk? This measures the spread of scale over sliding 5 m windows within a walk.
- **A3, the wall plane.** What share of the error runs across the direction of travel, which a wall plane would remove, compared with along it?
- **A4, a range to the meter.** A second phone left at the meter ranges the walking phone by UWB (σ 10 cm, simulated) at every window end. What is the p90 left over?

## Pass criteria, fixed before the run

- **A1.** Across loops, the largest error between visits is at most max(2r, 2 in) in at least 90% of loops, so r can set a per-session error bar. Needs at least 8 loops.
- **A2.** One reference object near the meter is enough if the within-walk spread is under 1% (1 SD). Drop that idea if it is over 3%.
- **A3.** A wall-plane constraint is worth building if the along-travel p90 is at most 60% of the total p90 at 20 ft.
- **A4.** The p90 at 20 and 30 ft is at most 6 in.

## Result

All four fail. Tables: [results/drift_anatomy.md](results/drift_anatomy.md).

- **A1.** 30 of 56 MARViN loops (54%). ADVIO has no revisit under 0.3 m while ARKit tracks. Scale and heading error cancel on return, so r misses them.
- **A2.** 5.7% SD on MARViN, 19% on ADVIO: drop. A few outlier windows inflate MARViN's SD; its robust SD is 1.8%.
- **A3.** At 20 ft, along is 0.92 of the p90 on MARViN and 0.76 on ADVIO.
- **A4.** MARViN goes from 10.4 and 13.6 in to 7.7 and 8.5 in. At σ 10 cm the range's own p90 is 6.5 in, so the bar was nearly out of reach. At 5 cm: 4.9 and 6.1 in.

**Run:** `uv run python run.py`. Needs the evals checkout at 190ed33 (`EVALS_HARNESS`) and MARViN and ADVIO in `~/house-scanning-data`.

**What it changes:** the error worth attacking runs along travel. A range to the meter reduces it, a wall plane wouldn't, and r can't bound a session.
