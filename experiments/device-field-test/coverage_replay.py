"""Replay a House Scan scene.json's kept photos through the app's coverage rules.

For each kept photo, in order, prints how far the covered wall reaches on each side of the
meter: the same `reach` that "Can't get there" uses to place a wall end. Then prints, for
the cells either side of the meter, which photos saw each sample row.

The rules mirror `CoverageMap` and `GuidancePlanner.reach` on `t3/ios-mvf` at ff95f1c:
- 6 in cells;
- wall rows at 0, 3.25 and 6.5 ft up; ground rows at 0, 2 and 4 ft out;
- a row counts when its two samples, a quarter and three quarters across the cell, are in view:
  within 6 m, within 65 degrees of the surface normal, and 3 % inside the image edges;
- a cell is covered when every row was seen from two positions at least 0.25 m apart.

Limits: it uses the exported (refined) wall line and meter for every photo, cannot see
tracking state, and ignores marked ends, so it shows what coverage would have been with no ends.
