/// between passes ("12 photos taken" becomes "13 photos taken" on the photo count), and a label
/// in the key made one failure on one element look like two different issues, so it was dropped.

/// one row in the first pass and another row in the second then counts as repeated, which can
/// only fail the test, never hide a failure.

/// Its frame is not: ScreenStatesUITests scrolls between the passes. An unidentified element whose
/// label changes between passes can still escape the repeat check, so anything on screen whose
/// text changes live should carry an identifier. An issue with no element is keyed by its type.
