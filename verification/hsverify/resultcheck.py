"""Judge a placement result (contract C2) against its scene (C1) and the decision rule (C5).

Everything here is pure: a scene and a result go in, a list of problems comes out. The
checks hold for any policy and any rule values, so they can run on every response:

- decision consistency: what `pass`, `reject` and `manual_review` each require of the rest
  of the record;
- the margin rule: a check's outcome must follow from its measurement, error and threshold
  (PASS only when the margin beats the error, and clears the review line when the check has
  one; FAIL only when past the threshold by more than the error; otherwise UNSURE);
- coverage: no battery position passes without the coverage each passing check needs, as the
  server's README ("What settles each check") states it: the wall seen high enough over the
  clearance's reach, the ground out to the battery's depth plus the reach, the facing and
  overhead bands unless measured, and the cable route. The reach includes the battery's
  position error, which depends on how the wall was found. Only points within reach whatever
  the wall's shape are required, so a correct server is not flagged;
- requests: every check left unsure for coverage is named for each band it lacks, and nothing
  is requested that was already seen as far as the request needs;
- bookkeeping: counts add up, the input hash matches what was sent, the spot's offset from
  the meter matches its centre.

Case expectations (a scene plus the outcomes geometry forces) and the mirror transform used
for the left-right symmetry check also live here.
