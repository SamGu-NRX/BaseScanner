"""scene.json out: the reconstruction's wall line, coverage and measured gaps in the server's
contract (server/schemas/scene.schema.json and "What settles each check" in server/README.md on
t3/server). Feet, in the scene frame: the world with the ground at the wall at y = 0.

A scan bundle's scene is updated: the meter's wall takes the fitted line (over the union of its
fitted extent and the phone's baseline), `coverage.observed` is replaced by the occlusion-aware
coverage, and the measured facing gaps and overhead clearances are added to whatever the phone
marked. A Measure Lab session gets a new scene with the same parts.

The fitted wall takes the source of the depth that built it (`pipeline.WALL_SOURCE`: "mesh" from
LiDAR, "plane" from photos alone) and no `plus_minus_ft`; a bundle's tapped bound is removed. The
server then applies that source's default error plus its drift per foot walked from the meter
(errors.mesh_ft, plane_ft and drift_per_ft in server/rules.yaml on t3/server). An explicit bound
would switch the drift off: the server adds none to a wall that carries one, so a LiDAR wall
30 ft from the meter would stay at 0.5 ft instead of about 5.3 ft. Keeping the old line's
provenance would be wrong too: a bundle's tap source and bound, or with none the tap default of
0.3 ft, describe a line the reconstruction replaced.
